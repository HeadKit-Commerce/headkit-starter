/**
 * The canonical 308 target for a storefront path, for `proxy.ts`.
 *
 * WHY THE PROXY CANNOT JUST CALL THE FUNCTION. `canonicalRedirectForPath`
 * resolves through `"use cache"` reads, which middleware cannot run; the proxy
 * already reaches its other per-store value the same way
 * (`/api/posts-base-path`). This endpoint is the difference between the two:
 * that one is fetched on EVERY page request, which is why it carries two values
 * rather than having a second endpoint. This one is fetched only for a request
 * that is BOTH in a consolidating route family AND carrying a query string —
 * the narrow case where a 308 would otherwise throw a campaign's `gclid`,
 * `utm_*` or `_kx` away (issue #74) — so it costs nothing on ordinary traffic.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS WHEN IT IS HIT. Nothing at the WordPress origin that the
 * request was not already going to pay. Both decision functions resolve through
 * the SAME `"use cache"` entries the routes themselves await —
 * `getCachedProduct` (`cacheLife("max")`) and `getCategoryData` — so a warm
 * catalogue answers from cache, and a cold one pays the single read the route
 * would have paid a moment later. That matters here specifically: this store's
 * origin is rate-limited to ~1.8 req/s and a runaway read pattern has caused an
 * outage before.
 *
 * NOT AUTHENTICATED, and it does not need to be. It reveals only which path a
 * URL redirects to — something any client learns by issuing the request — and
 * the reads it can reach are exactly the two the public `/products/...` and
 * `/collections/...` routes already perform for an arbitrary slug. A path
 * outside those two families resolves to `null` without reading anything.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT cached at the HTTP layer: the caching that matters is the
 * `"use cache"` entries underneath, and a second lifetime on top would be a
 * second thing that can pin a wrong redirect.
