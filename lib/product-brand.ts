/**
 * Brand logo for the PDP — ONE cache entry per brand, shared by every product
 * that carries it.
 *
 * Tagged `TAG.brands` — the PLURAL term tag — and deliberately NOT
 * `TAG.brand(slug)`. The two name two different data domains, and this read is
 * in the second one:
 *
 *   - `headkit:brand:{slug}` means "the set of products in this brand changed".
 *     The theme fires it on EVERY save of a product in the brand, including a
 *     stock change arriving from an order (`headkit_product_brand_tags`,
 *     reached from the product builder). `/brand/{slug}`'s grid subscribes to
 *     it, correctly.
 *   - `headkit:brands` means "a brand TERM was created, edited or deleted" —
 *     exactly when a brand's name or logo can change. It is emitted only from
 *     the `brands_data` endpoint suffix, reachable only from the
 *     `product_brand` branches of `created_term` / `edited_term` /
 *     `delete_term`. No product event path reaches it
 *     (`lib/wp-revalidation-events.test.ts` asserts that against the theme).
 *
 * This read answers the brand TERM's name and logo, so the term tag is the one
 * whose events actually change its output. Carrying the product-SET tag instead
 * meant one stock movement on any product in a brand purged the prerendered PDP
 * entry of every other product in it, none of whose logos had changed — tags
 * propagate outward unconditionally onto the awaiting route's CDN entry.
 *
 * THE TRADE THIS ACCEPTS, so nobody re-derives it: `headkit:brands` reaches
 * every PDP on the store, not only one brand's, so a brand-term edit now
 * refreshes all of them. That is a rare admin action against the most frequent
 * event in the system, and it is an INVALIDATION rather than a deletion, so
 * each page serves its previous copy while refreshing behind the request.
 * `headkit:brands` is therefore classified WIDE in `lib/cache-tags.ts`; that
 * classification is not optional and must not be reverted while this line
 * stands, or one brand-term edit becomes a site-wide DELETION. A narrower fix
 * needs a new `headkit:brand-term:{slug}` tag, which needs a theme release.
 *
 * A failed brand read is a missing logo, never a failed PDP: the product is
 * the page, the logo is decoration. `brands.get` answers the brand detail
 * (with a page of its products), so only the three fields the PDP needs are
 * returned — a "use cache" entry stores its return value.
