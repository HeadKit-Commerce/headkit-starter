/**
 * The canonical 308 must carry the incoming QUERY STRING (issue #74).
 *
 * WHAT THIS COVERS, and it is the whole chain the proxy runs except the wire:
 * the gate that decides a request is a candidate
 * (`isCanonicalRedirectCandidate`), the REAL decision functions the endpoint
 * calls (`canonicalRedirectForPath` → `canonicalCollectionRedirect` /
 * `canonicalProductRedirect`, driven through mocked SDK reads), and the URL the
 * proxy builds from the two (`canonicalRedirectUrl`). Composing them in one
 * test is deliberate: a gate test and a target test that both pass
 * INDIVIDUALLY are green while the query is dropped between them, which is
 * exactly the shape of the bug.
 *
 * WHERE IT STOPS. It issues no HTTP request and runs no middleware, so it
 * cannot see the status code, the `Location` header, or that `proxy.ts` calls
 * any of this at all. A 308 is a STATUS LINE, and the only thing that observes
 * one is a request to a built, running app — `e2e/canonical-url-308.spec.ts`
 * owns that half, including the two query-preservation cases. It also says
 * nothing about `app/products/[...slug]/page.tsx` and
 * `app/collections/[...slug]/page.tsx` still redirecting for a request with NO
 * query: that is the same e2e spec's original four cases.
