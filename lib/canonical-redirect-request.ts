 * `lib/canonical-redirect-request.test.ts` is the guard. The DECISION of where
 * a path redirects to is not here; that is the routes' own, reached through
 * `/api/canonical-redirect` (see `lib/canonical-redirect.ts`).

/**
 * True when the proxy should resolve this request's canonical target itself
 * instead of leaving the 308 to the route.
 *
 * The gate is deliberately narrow, because each candidate costs one subrequest:
 *
 * - **A query string is required.** With no query there is nothing to preserve,
 *   so the route's own `permanentRedirect` is already correct and the proxy
 *   stays entirely out of the way. That is the overwhelming majority of
 *   traffic, crawlers included, and it is byte-for-byte unchanged.
 * - **GET and HEAD only.** A Server Action POSTs to the page's own URL, which
 *   on a listing route routinely carries a query string; those must never pay a
 *   lookup.
 * - **`/products/...` always qualifies**, because the canonical for a product
 *   is under `/shop/...` — so a flat product URL is non-canonical unless the
 *   product has no category ancestry at all.
 * - **`/collections/...` only when the CATEGORY part is a single segment.**
 *   That is the shape that actually redirects, and it is the one the WordPress
 *   theme emits: measured on this store, 127 of 127 category menu links arrive
 *   flat. A nested `/collections/parent/child` is canonical for every category
 *   the tree agrees about, so excluding it keeps ordinary browsing
 *   (`?page=`, `?sort=`, `?q=`) free of subrequests. The cost of the exclusion
 *   is stated rather than hidden: a nested path whose parent is WRONG still
 *   308s from the route with its query dropped, exactly as it does today.
 *
 * One more class never reaches here at all, and it is the proxy's matcher
 * rather than this rule: `proxy.ts` excludes any path containing a dot, so an
 * encoded facet URL (`/collections/locks/f/colour.black?gclid=…`) keeps today's
 * behaviour. Widening the matcher would change which requests the maintenance
 * gate and the `X-Robots-Tag` header see, which is a bigger decision than this.
