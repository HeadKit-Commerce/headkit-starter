/**
 * What the Google Tag Manager container expects from this storefront.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Provenance
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Measured 2026-09-22 against Bike Society's live container, fetched from its
 * public endpoint `https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id=GTM-TFBM7QP`
 * (165 KB). GA4 property `G-Q55ZJLNXWW`, Google Ads `AW-11387752908`. The
 * container holds 18 GA4 event tags (`__gaawe`), 12 Google Ads conversion tags
 * (`__awct`, 12 distinct labels) and 1 Conversion Linker. Event-name references
 * counted inside it:
 *
 *   purchase 12 · view_item 8 · begin_checkout 5 · add_to_cart 5 ·
 *   view_cart 3 · add_to_wishlist 3
 *
 * The same container is loaded by the classic WooCommerce site, whose PDP
 * `dataLayer` after load reads
 * `["gtm.js", "ecommerce", "view_item", "gtm.dom", "gtm.load", "ecommerce",
 * "view_item"]` — so the names below are not aspirational, they are what the
 * live tags already trigger on.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this file is a fixture and not a set of inline expectations
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The other half of this contract lives in a GTM container that is edited in a
 * web UI by someone who will never see this repository, and it cannot be
 * type-checked, imported or version-controlled here. A refactor that renames
 * `item_id` to `itemId`, or `purchase` to `order_complete`, compiles, passes
 * every other test, ships — and silently stops twelve Google Ads conversion
 * labels from firing. Nothing else in the codebase would notice.
 *
 * So the strings are duplicated here ON PURPOSE. This file is the tripwire: it
 * must be edited deliberately, with the container edited to match, and a diff
 * that touches it is the signal to a reviewer that an external contract moved.
