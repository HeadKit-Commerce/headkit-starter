/**
 * The rule behind the layout-chrome classification, in executable form:
 * **a cache tag's blast-radius class follows its CARRIERS, not what the tag
 * means.** Anything reachable from a read `app/layout.tsx` awaits is on every
 * CDN entry in the storefront by construction, because under Cache Components a
 * tag declared inside a nested cached read propagates outward onto the awaiting
 * route's entry unconditionally.
 *
 * Classifying such a tag NARROW sends it to `revalidateTag(t, { expire: 0 })`,
 * an unconditional DELETE — so one branding save destroys every prerendered
 * page on the store, and nothing re-warms them but real visitors each paying a
 * cold render.
 *
 * A hand-kept list of five tags cannot catch the SIXTH. So this file derives
 * the set from source instead:
 *
 *   1. `app/layout.tsx` must await exactly the reads declared in
 *      `LAYOUT_AWAITED_READS` — adding a read to the layout fails here until
 *      someone declares which module carries it and what it tags.
 *   2. every `cacheTag(...)` argument in those carrier modules must classify
 *      WIDE through the real `invalidatesManyPages`.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT cover
 *
 * It is a SOURCE reading. It does not render the layout, does not execute a
 * cached read, and cannot see a tag added at runtime or one reached through a
 * call chain deeper than the carrier module's own `cacheTag` line (a carrier
 * that awaits a further cached read propagates that read's tags too, and this
 * file would not notice). It observes no CDN and no cache header: that the
 * route sends the wide class through `invalidateByTag` is
 * `app/api/revalidate/route.test.ts`, and only a runtime log on a deployment
 * can show `x-vercel-cache: STALE`.
 *
 * It also proves nothing about the blast RADIUS. The classification decides the
 * mechanism only — a chrome purge still marks every entry in the storefront.
