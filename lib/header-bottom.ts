/**
 * Where the header ends, published once and read by anything that must sit under
 * it.
 *
 * The measurement itself is not new: `NavigationBar` has always taken
 * `getBoundingClientRect().bottom` off the sticky nav — on mount, on scroll and on
 * resize — to place the mobile sheet and its overlay flush under the logo bar. That
 * is the right source because it already accounts for the preheader: the nav is
 * `sticky top-0` BELOW a preheader in normal flow, so at the top of the page its
 * bottom is `preheader height + 80` and after scrolling past the preheader it is
 * `80`. A second measurement taken anywhere else would have to re-derive that, and
 * would drift the first time the header gains a row.
 *
 * WHY A CSS CUSTOM PROPERTY RATHER THAN REACT STATE. The value changes on every
 * scroll frame. Routing it through state would re-render the consumer dozens of
 * times a second; as a custom property on `<html>` the browser re-resolves the
 * `top` of anything reading it with no React work at all, which is what makes the
 * offset TRACK the header instead of freezing at its mounted value. That freeze is
 * the specific defect that sank the first attempt at a header-aware navigation
 * skeleton on the fork (measured once on mount, so any scroll afterwards slid the
 * old page through the uncovered strip); see `navigation-skeleton.tsx`.
 *
 * The fallback in {@link headerBottomCssValue} is the nav's own default height, so
 * a consumer that renders before the first publish starts under a header-sized
 * strip rather than at 0 — never covering the header, even for one frame.
