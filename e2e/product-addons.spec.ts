/**
 * WooCommerce Product Add-Ons end-to-end — the PLUGIN-PRESENT half (phase 14.1,
 * plan 14.1-07).
 *
 * Every claim this phase makes up to here is asserted at the layer that produced
 * it: the theme's payload in PHP, the wire shape in Go, the encoder in a vitest
 * unit. This spec is where those layers are checked against EACH OTHER, because
 * three of the phase's success criteria are only falsifiable from an end-to-end
 * run — that the charged price is the plugin's, that the selections reach the
 * merchant's order, and that a rejected submission no longer wedges checkout.
 *
 * REQUIREMENT MAP
 *
 *   PAO-02  "pricing and validation are the plugin's, server-side"
 *     - `price authority` — a hand-built hostile add-item stuffed with every
 *       price channel a naive integration might have invented changes the
 *       charge by NOTHING, asserted against an exact counterfactual.
 *     - `price authority` — the three price types asserted against RESEARCH's
 *       measured table, each at two quantities so the per-unit and per-line
 *       behaviours are distinguishable rather than coincidentally equal.
 *     - `hidden option` — amendment A-1: the wire index is the option's
 *       position in the RECEIVED array. A group whose index-0 option is hidden
 *       is the only fixture shape that can fail on a reindexing regression.
 *
 *   PAO-03  "selections visible in cart, checkout, confirmation, and on the
 *            merchant's WooCommerce order"
 *     - `PDP and purchase` — the panel on the cart drawer line and on the order
 *       confirmation, by group name AND chosen value; then the merchant's own
 *       wc/v3 order carrying PAO's readable meta rows, its `_pao_ids` structured
 *       list and its `_pao_total`.
 *     - The CHECKOUT SUMMARY surface is NOT asserted here and cannot be — see
 *       "THE ONE UNREACHABLE SURFACE" below. That is a recorded environment
 *       gap, not an omission.
 *
 *   PAO-05  "a rejected add-on submission cannot wedge the shopper's checkout"
 *     - `rejection and recovery` — the measured five-step sequence on ONE cart
 *       token, plus the narrow half of the measurement (which codes leave the
 *       session clean), plus the storefront's own attribution of the rejection,
 *       plus the R1 drift guard exercised through the whole stack.
 *
 *   RESEARCH Pitfall 2
 *     - `variable product` — parent-id and variation-id add-items with add-ons.
 *
 * NO SELF-SKIPPING ON A MISSING FIXTURE — a deliberate deviation from the
 * `gift-card.spec.ts` model this file otherwise follows. That spec self-skips
 * when a prerequisite is absent, which is right for a paid gift-card code that
 * CI cannot provision. It is wrong here. The add-on fixtures are committed as a
 * seed, so their absence means the seed regressed — and RESEARCH Pitfall 6 names
 * the exact failure mode: a fixture product that is only reachable BECAUSE it
 * has add-ons will, on losing them, silently skip every assertion and report
 * green. That is the false pass this whole phase exists to avoid. The health
 * probe below therefore gates on ONE thing — the stack being reachable — and
 * `readFixture` THROWS, naming the seed file, for anything else.
 *
 * THE ONE UNREACHABLE SURFACE (measured by plan 14.1-06, re-stated so nobody
 * re-derives it): `/checkout` mints a Stripe Checkout Session during SSR and the
 * local commerce process holds `sk_test_…placeholder`, so it 307s to
 * `/checkout/error?reason=session_creation_failed`. The documented free-cart
 * escape hatch (`e2e-free-100` + `pickup_location:0`) DOES render `/checkout` —
 * but `checkout-page-content.tsx` returns the free-order confirm UI BEFORE the
 * `{checkoutSession ? …}` block that holds `<Cart>`, so the summary column does
 * not exist on the only branch that renders. The summary line IS
 * `LineItemDisplay`, the same component this spec proves live on the
 * confirmation page, and `line-item-display.test.tsx` pins its call site. What
 * is unproven is the surrounding page. A real `sk_test_` key on commerce is the
 * prerequisite; see 14.1-06's deferred item 5.
 *
 * LOCAL-ONLY (HARD RULE): every endpoint is a localhost Docker service —
 * starter (E2E_BASE_URL), WP/WooCommerce :8090, gateway (E2E_GATEWAY_URL).
 * No staging/prod host may appear. This spec places real orders on the LOCAL
 * store, which is what the wedge sequence and the purchase path are.
 *
 * THIS SPEC MUTATES NO PLUGIN STATE. It never activates, deactivates or
 * configures a WordPress plugin and contains no shell escape. The plugin-ABSENT
 * gate is plan 14.1-09's, it is a coordinated action on a shared stack, and it
 * is separately checkpointed.
 *
 * PREREQUISITES (stack up + seeded):
 *   - WordPress + WooCommerce   http://localhost:8090   (WP_BASE_URL)
 *   - WooCommerce Product Add-Ons 8.4.0 ACTIVE
 *   - services/commerce (Go), Hive Gateway, starter (Next)
 *   - docker/wordpress/seed-product-addons.php applied, providing:
 *       glam-booth-package       $1299, 5 groups (1 global first + 4 own),
 *                                required group `Backdrop Design` (1900000003)
 *       glam-booth-all-types     $499, 8 groups, all three price types
 *       glam-booth-variable      variable, 2 parent-level groups
 *       glam-booth-hidden-first  $100, index-0 option hidden (A-1 fixture)

/**
 * The three PURCHASE HAZARDS of the pinned Product Add-Ons 8.4.0 release
 * (plan 15.2a-03, RESEARCH 15.2a §Pitfall 1).
 *
 * WHY THIS BLOCK EXISTS. Before it, the seed published exactly two of the three
 * `multiple_choice` display modes, so this file was STRUCTURALLY INCAPABLE of
 * catching the one hazard the phase had already measured — and had no fixture
 * at all for the two the research then found. A suite that cannot fail on a
 * known defect is not covering it.
 *
 * EVERY ASSERTION BELOW IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT A PREDICTION. Each was executed
 * against the local Docker WordPress and recorded, with the observed status,
 * error code, post-rejection cart state and the plugin file-and-line that
 * explains it, in
 * `.planning/phases/15.2-pebblr-booth-rehearsal/artifacts/15.2a-03-pao-hazards-measured.md`.
 * Two of the research's own claims were corrected by that run; the cases follow
 * the measurement, not the research.
 *
 * THESE CASES ASSERT CURRENTLY-BROKEN BEHAVIOUR. That is deliberate and it is
 * the point: each one goes RED the day the plugin is fixed upstream, which is
 * precisely when someone needs to know. On that day INVERT the case into a
 * passing regression guard — do not delete it. The docblock on each names the
 * upstream lines to re-read when it fires.
 *
 * CODES, NEVER MESSAGES — the convention every other add-on assertion in this
 * file follows, for the reason `verify-pao-wedge.sh` records: the same rejection
 * reads with encoded quotes through `GET /cart` and literal quotes through the
 * direct 400, so any string comparison across the two paths is a false failure
 * waiting to happen.
 *
 * NO FRESH TOKEN MID-SEQUENCE. Every deliberate rejection is followed by a cart
 * read on the SAME token requiring an empty error list. A 400 followed by a 201
 * looks fine while the session is quietly poisoned (PAO-05); minting a new token
 * between the rejection and the read would test nothing, because the whole
 * defect is that the poison PERSISTS on the session.
