/**
 * The tax-inclusive guard for the CHECKOUT SUMMARY.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE FROM `tax-inclusive-display.spec.ts`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * This test loads `/checkout`, and `app/checkout/page.tsx` mints a Stripe
 * Checkout Session for any non-zero, non-offline-only cart — redirecting to
 * `/checkout/error?reason=session_creation_failed` when commerce has no Stripe
 * key. The taxed fixture is A$110, so this test cannot run without
 * `STRIPE_TEST_SECRET_KEY`, and CI treats a missing secret as an EXPECTED
 * state, not an error.
 *
 * So this file is listed in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s conditional
 * Stripe-absent ignore list, alongside `checkout-purchase` / `checkout-auth` /
 * `coupon` and the rest. Its two siblings — the anti-vacuous fixture check and
 * the cart-drawer assertions — deliberately stayed in
 * `tax-inclusive-display.spec.ts` and run UNCONDITIONALLY: the drawer is the
 * highest-value assertion in the whole guard (no tax row to reconcile against)
 * and the fixture check is what stops everything else passing vacuously.
 * Folding the whole spec into the ignore list would have taken both with it.
 *
 * Gating lives in the workflow, NOT in a `test.skip()` here. A spec that skips
 * itself when its dependency is absent reports green, which is the exact false
 * pass this suite has removed elsewhere — see ci.yml's own comments.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED
 * ----------------
 *   1. the checkout summary line renders `line_subtotal + line_subtotal_tax`;
 *   2. its tax row is labelled informationally ("Includes tax"), not as an
 *      addend, because the Subtotal row above it is now inclusive too;
 *   3. the bare ex-tax figure appears nowhere on the page.
 *
 * Every expected number is computed from the Store API response captured in the
 * same run — never a hard-coded literal. The fixture and its money shape come
 * from `seedTaxedCart` in `./helpers`, shared with the sibling spec.
 *
 * PREREQUISITES (self-skips only when the whole stack is down):
 *   - local Docker stack (WP :8090, gateway :4000, starter E2E_BASE_URL)
 *   - the taxed fixture from docker/wordpress/seed-tax.php
 *   - a Stripe TEST key on commerce
 *
 * LOCAL-ONLY (HARD RULE): localhost Docker services only; Stripe TEST mode only.
